# Hosts

All of Seattle DevOps Monthly events are conducted online via Zoom.

If we meet in person, Chef Software has been our home location for Seattle DevOps Meetup for the past 3 years.

In the event where Zoom or Chef Software is unable to host or we desire a change of venue there are some other options available to us.
