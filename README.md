# Seattle DevOps Meetup

This is the planning repository for the [Seattle DevOps Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Seattle-DevOps-Meetup/).

Seattle DevOps is for people interested in the people, processes, and technologies related to DevOps.

+ Each month we invite two speakers to present on anything related to DevOps

+ Talks are about 20 minutes (or less) with 5 minutes reserved for questions and answers

+ We believe that everybody plays a role in DevOps

+ All talks are remote/virtual and hosted via Zoom.us

# Example Topics include:

+ Deploying & Managing Kubernetes with Kubernetes

+ Running SRE

+ Serverless, How It Makes DevOps Easier

+ Putting Burnout on Backstreet

# We have a few house rules:

+ The objective of the group is to provide a welcoming and inclusive setting to learn about DevOps topics 

+ We ask for all members and attendees at our meetups to abide by our Code of Conduct. 

+ No Vendor pitches (Even if you are sponsoring)

+ Be respectful of the audience
